FitPass Optimization

This code provides an algorithm to optimize recommendations for FitPass fitness classes. It uses a combination of user preferences, gym location, and activity preferences to generate a list of recommended classes.


Code Structure
The code is structured into the following main functions:
distance_studio_loss: Calculates the distance loss for a given gym.
create_problem: Creates a linear programming problem that optimizes the selection of classes.
solve_problem: Solves the linear programming problem.
generate_solution: Generates a solution from the linear programming problem.
fitpass_optimization: Optimizes recommendations for FitPass fitness classes.



Input Parameters
The code takes the following input parameters:
user_info: A dictionary containing user information, including location, preferences, and usage patterns.
dict_weights: A dictionary containing weights for the different factors in the optimization.
list_activities: A list of all available activities.
dict_variables: A dictionary containing variables for the linear programming problem.



Output
The code outputs the following:
df_solution: A dataframe containing the recommended classes.
dict_solution: A dictionary containing the solution to the linear programming problem.
function_value: The value of the objective function for the linear programming problem.
